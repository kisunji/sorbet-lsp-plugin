# This repository

This repository is to build a production-ready Sorbet LSP plugin for the IntelliJ suite of IDEs.

JetBrains recently announced their new LSP API here: https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2025/09/the-lsp-api-is-now-available-to-all-intellij-idea-users-and-plugin-developers/

The LSP SDK docs are here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/language-server-protocol.html
